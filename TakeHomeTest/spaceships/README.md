Question:

Mr Little Z has multiple spaceships in his spaceport, and he finds it hard to keep track of them. He has built a web application to help him find the best spaceship for the job each day.

For maximum efficiency, Mr Little Z would like to be able to filter his spaceships on the following attributes:

- Colour
- Pulse laser
- Average speed

He also wants to be able to share the URL with other people so that the filters are applied on the first load. Unfortunately, Mr Little Z is not an Engineer and hasnâ€™t built his app very well and is also missing some key features from his app.
He needs you to finish the app for him. He needs you to:

- Build the average speed filter. This should be able to filter by:
  - Less than
  - Greater than
  - Between
- Load filters from the URL on first load of the app
- Find and fix any bugs in the existing code
- Refactor any code you think could be done more efficiently

Things we want to see:

- Build your filter component from scratch (please do not use a UI component library, like MUI or AntD)
- Creative design of your filter component
- Clean self documenting code
- Ability to spot and fix bugs
- Sensible refactoring to the code
